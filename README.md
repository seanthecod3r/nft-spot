# NftSpot

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.5. This is a website dedicated to everything NFTs. My main goal with this project is to practice my Angular skills, and attempt to have extremely performant core web vitals. I realize that Angular likely isn't the best framework for this project. If I was choosing the best framework for what I was trying to create here, it would likely be next.js, so I would have an easy time with SEO. However, as I said, I am trying to increase my Angular knowledge, so I'm not too concerned with having the best version of "NFT Spot" on this run.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
