* A lot of the tech websites I'm looking at use a main page scheme with 3 columns.
  - Wired has a leftcolumn with today's picks with larger sized articles, a middle
    column with the very biggest articles (in size and relevance), and a right column 
    with "most recent", these are the smallest
  - Techcrunch also has 3 columns, but one is the sidebar
* I like the idea of a "Today's picks" on the main page of NFTSpot
* Need to figure out what kind of links I want in the header
* Looks like I can implement SSR for SEO at any point using the Angular Universal library

4/17
*Left side of page will be NFTs of the week.
*Website will be in 3 sections. Left will be NFTs of the week, middle will be articles, and the right
 will be either random NFTs or something like that. Possibly have a promoted work section?
